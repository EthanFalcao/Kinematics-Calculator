# Kinematics-Calculator
 The Kinematics Calculator is an open-source calculator on GitHub that quickly solves for the missing parameter in kinematics equations based on user-provided inputs of time, distance, initial velocity, and final velocity. By providing three out of the four parameters, the calculator automatically computes the missing value.
 
## Features:
 - Simple and intuitive interface for easy input of known values.
 - Automatic calculation of the missing parameter based on the provided inputs.
 - Versatility in solving various kinematics scenarios, such as determining time, distance, initial velocity, or final velocity.
 - Accurate results ensured through precise mathematical algorithms.
 - Open-source project hosted on GitHub, encouraging collaboration, contributions, and customization.
 
## Usage:
 1) Input three known values (Time, Distance, Initial Velocity, Final Velocity) into the corresponding fields.
 2) Make sure to enter the known values using the appropriate units (e.g., seconds, meters per second).
 3) The calculator will automatically compute and display the missing value in the corresponding field.
 4) Clear the input fields to solve a new problem or update the existing values.
